        <p>there is more to be done, I know.<br><br>we have plants to water, stems to propogate, arrangements to reorder. <br><br><br>but the days have been so short, my Love. and the cold has crept into our bones, stifling movement. <br><br>when there is a moment of warmth i allow my Hands to clasp with Yours. <br><br>its hard outside, the noises are so loud.<br> and we've been through so much-<br> don't we deserve a small break?<br><br>pulling eachother along, trudging through the sludge. we remind ourselves of <br>the plants to water, the stems to propograte, the arrangements to reorder.</p>
